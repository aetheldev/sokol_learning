# Master Ticket List

Goal: one ordered path from beginner Odin/Sokol learning to real `sauce/` production game work.

Main goal reminder:
- standalone lessons are practice only
- real destination is making those games inside `sauce/`
- if you finish Sokoban, card game, or co-op prototype outside `sauce/`, next step is rebuilding them in `sauce/`

How to use this file:
- Do tickets in order.
- Do not skip practice.
- Do not chase polish too early.
- Only move on when you can explain what you built.
